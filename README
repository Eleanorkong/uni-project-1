Assignment Project :
design document and report are in doc folder.
data folder : all raw data sets and formatted data set (named data). 
src folder : data_formatting folder; 
             explore_data folder; 
             main simulate_test function; 
             four functions for graphs; 
             scenarios folder (data analysis under each scenario); 
             tests folder (input and output test functions for simulate_test function). 
results folder : all created plots.
doc folder : pdf of design document and report. 

Note : for code to create plots in src folder under scenario section, 
the chosen width is quite small due to the purpose of the report. Thus, 
it may take some time to run. If just want to gain a general idea of how 
power and size distributed, we suggest to choose a suitable width 
(increment of the sequence).
